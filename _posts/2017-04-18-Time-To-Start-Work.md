Finally got the motivation/time to start looking at the MSU devkit I acquired. My old 386 motherboard decided to pack in, so I nabbed a new (read old) replacement from ebay.

The oscilloscope was used to verify that the devit produces some sort of display from the VGA port.

I've dumped the EPROMs from the board, they don't match the version I have (taken from a different devkit IIRC).
