Yup, I've found the port - The picture below is grabbed from my Logic16 probe, hooked up to a breadboard and arduino. The arduino was running a simple sketch to run through all the address and roughly simulate the ISA port read/write timings.

From the top :

*  A1
*  A4
*  A5
*  A6
*  A7
*  A8
*  A9
*  ~IORD
*  ~IOWR
*  IOCS16
*  ?

The image shows just over 1 complete address cycle (from 0x000 - 0x3FF). You should be able to see the chip seems to be responding for a particular set of inputs (first 9 lines of traces are inputs, rest are inputs/outputs). This actually coincides with the following address in binary : 10 0000 xx0x the x bits are don't care. So in principal the devkit should respond on address 0x200, a quick test revealed 0x3CFF on the port. This isn't correct, I should have seen 0x0000 or 0x0400. 

Fortunately a quick google revealed that port 0x200 is commonly the Game Port, and sure enough my host PC had a gameport that was enabled, I pulled the devkit out, disabled the game port, retried reading 0x200. I got 0xFFFF (this is good, this should indicate nothing is responding). I plugged the devkit back in, and this time I get : 0x0400 (Bingo!).

Next steps are to write a program to attempt to readback memory from the devkit via the MSUBIOS protocol.
